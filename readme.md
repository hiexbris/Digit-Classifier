# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognizer (from Scratch)

This is a simple neural network built **entirely from scratch (no PyTorch or TensorFlow)** to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. After training, you can draw digits using a `pygame` interface, and the model will predict what you wrote.
